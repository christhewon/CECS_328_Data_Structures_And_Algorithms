•Exams

	◦ Exam2 
 
		1. Find the index of the smallest number in a sorted array where the first k numbers
	   	   were shifted to the end.
	   
		2. You are given k sorted arrays in descending order of size n. Develop an algorithm to
	           merge them into a single sorted array of size kn.
	   
 	◦ Final_Project
 
		1. You are given a random weighted graph. Can you find the shortest distance from a as an
	   	   initial vertex to the other vertices? 
	   
		2. Let’s say we are given an array of strings and we are interested to see if we can create a
	   	   cycle using its elements. To create the cycle, string A comes right after string B if the last character of
	   	   B is same as first character of A.
	   
		3. A number in a sorted array is given to you. Can you find the index of first
	   	   and last occurrence of the number in the array?
